  <h1>2000s - Wii Sports</h1>

  <h3>82.90 Million Units Sold</h3>
  <p>Releasing as a launch title prepackaged with the Nintendo Wii in 2006, Wii Sports is a collection of 5 sports games created to show off the Wii's controls, the system's uniqueness, and serve as an entry point to those new to playing video games. While some might argue that being prepacked with the Wii inflates its sales numbers, I'm not one of those people. The numbers are what they are.</p>
